TASK 1 - AS 1 

All IP addresses have been preconfigured as specified in the topology picture.
Configure EIGRP on all routers, disable auto-summary. Achieve full connectivity.
Change the EIGRP metrics so only delay is being used for the calculations.
Change the delay on every interface (including the loopback) to 300usec
If you send a ping from router Jermaine to the loopback of router Michael it should use the link to router Jackie. (succesor route)
Change the delays on the routers so the link between Jermaine and Tito becomes a feasible succesor route to reach the loopback.
Change the delays so traffic will be sent in a 1:5 ratio. Use the “show ip route 3.3.3.0” command to check this.

TASK 2 - AS 2: 

Configure EIGRP for AS 2 with the appropriate networks.
Disable auto-summary to ensure subnets are advertised correctly.
Verify connectivity within AS 2 by checking the routing tables and using ping tests.
Redistribute Routes Between AS 1 and AS 2:
Use route redistribution to share routes between AS 1 and AS 2.
Apply route maps to control which routes are redistributed and to prevent routing loops.
Avoid Redistributing Routes Back to Their Source AS:
Use route tagging to mark routes as they are redistributed into the other autonomous system.
Filter routes based on their tags to ensure that routes originating in one AS are not redistributed back into it.
