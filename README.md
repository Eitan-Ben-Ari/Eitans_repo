Feel free to contribute your networking, automation, or cybersecurity projects and scripts by pushing a new branch to the GitHub repository.
‚úÖYour Name needs to be included in the remote branch name for acceptance ü§† 
‚úÖexplain your project using a powerpoint slide or text file.
‚ùåDont try to push to the master branch, it won't work :)

instead create a local branch:
checkout -b yourname_feature

after the project files are ready:
git add -A #adds all new and changed               files to the snapshot 
git commit -m "Network monitoring project"    #commit your files

git push origin yourname_feature #creates a remote branch by the name of your local branch.
